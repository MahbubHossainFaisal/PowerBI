    "DAX, or Data Analysis Expressions, is a formula language used in Power BI for creating custom calculations and aggregations in data models. It is primarily used for defining calculated columns and measures. DAX functions operate on tables and columns, providing powerful capabilities for data manipulation, filtering, and performing complex calculations. Understanding DAX is crucial for creating dynamic and insightful reports in Power BI."

    "1. **Data Analysis Expressions (DAX):**\n",
    "   - DAX is a formula language used in Power BI, Excel, and other Microsoft tools.\n",
    "   - It's designed for creating custom calculations and aggregations in data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tables and Columns:**\n",
    "   - DAX operates on tables and columns within Power BI data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculated Columns:**\n",
    "   - Calculated columns are created in tables and compute values based on a DAX formula.\n",
    "   - They persist in the data model and can be used like any other column.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Measures:**\n",
    "   - Measures are dynamic calculations used for aggregations, often based on summarized data.\n",
    "   - They are defined in DAX and can be used in visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **DAX Functions:**\n",
    "   - DAX provides a rich set of functions for a variety of operations (e.g., mathematical, statistical, text, date).\n",
    "   - Common functions include SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, RELATED, CALCULATE, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Filter Context and Row Context:**\n",
    "   - DAX calculations are influenced by two contexts: filter context and row context.\n",
    "   - Understanding these contexts is crucial for writing effective DAX formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Relationships:**\n",
    "   - DAX relies on relationships between tables to perform calculations across related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Time Intelligence:**\n",
    "   - DAX includes functions for handling time-based calculations, such as year-to-date, quarter-to-date, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Aggregation and Iteration:**\n",
    "   - DAX supports both aggregation functions for summarizing data and iteration functions for row-by-row calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Variables:**\n",
    "    - DAX allows the use of variables to store intermediate results and enhance formula readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Context Transition:**\n",
    "    - DAX handles context transitions between row and filter contexts when evaluating formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering these concepts empowers users to create sophisticated and dynamic reports in Power BI. For interviews, it's essential to showcase practical applications of DAX, understand how it influences data analysis, and demonstrate proficiency in writing effective DAX formulas."
